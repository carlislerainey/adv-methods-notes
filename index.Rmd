# Week 1

## Class agenda.

**Goal of the class** Make you competent users and consumers (applied and methods papers) of methods beyond least-squares. I'm deliberately avoiding causal-inference methods (matching, DID, etc) because we have a class that covers those specifically that we're offering regularly. I want you to learn a lot about specific tools, but also develop the skills to go and learn more on your own.

We can deviate into any particular topic you'd find helpful.

**Structure of the class** 

We have three sources of information that we'll learn from:

1. *My lectures* I have a set of tools that I want to introduce you to throughout the semester. I think of the lecture as offering "an overview" as well as "my take" on the tool. I will not supply all the details--we don't have enough time and a lecture isn't the ideal medium for deep and subtle ideas. In the past, I have supplied all of my lecture notes to students. However, the research seems clear that student note-taking boosts learning. 
1. *Required readings* For each topic, I have a few readings selected to supply further details or offer a different perspective. I want you to carefully read the required readings, even if they seem familiar. 
1. *Suggested and other readings* I encourage you to engage readings beyond the required set. These might be "easier" readings (e.g., FPP) or more difficult readings (e.g., Greene). In this category, I want you to use judgement. If the required readings are easy, then I recommend moving on *after* seriously engaging the required readings. If the required readings are too difficult, then seek out gentler introductions. You should NOT pursue the suggested or other readings at the expense of the required readings.

**Assessments**

This semester, we have a large set of tools that you must demonstrate that you (1) understand and (2) can implement.

1. Exams: We will have regular exams that require you to implement and explain particular tools. I'm open to suggestions on frequency, but I suggest a *weekly*, open-book, take-home exam with about a one hour time limit. I will grade these as pass/fail. You can re-take a (slightly modified) exam up to three times if you fail.
1. Journal: I want to you to journal throughout the semester. I want you to spend *at least* three hours (hopefully more most weeks) outside of class working on your journal. This journal should have several parts:
   a. Class Notes
   a. Review Exercises
   a. Notes from the required readings, including summaries, reactions, and (especially) questions or flags for ideas you didn't understand. This latter is very important--it will make us all better.
   a. Notes from other readings. I want to give you a bit of space to explore things on your own. You could do a deeper dive on ideas covered carefully in the lectures or readings. Or you could pursue a tangential topic (but keep it somewhat related to class). Again, summaries, reactions, and questions are appropriate. I suggest engaging with reading from substantive course with this class in mind, and record your thoughts in your journal.
   a. Connections throughout the semester.
   a. Explorations of ideas for future projects.
